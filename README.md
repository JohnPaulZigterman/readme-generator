# README Generator - John Zigterman

## Description

- I set out to create an easy to use README generator.
- The generator takes in information from the user about their project, and generates a professional readme.
- The user is prompted for a title, description, installation and usage instructions, testing information, a license, and personal contact information.
- The readme is dynamically generated using their input and is produced in a ready to use manner.
- The user interface is a simple prompt in the console.

## Installation

This is a node.js application and requires the user to use node and to install inquirer for the prompts to function.

## Usage

A user who wishes to generate a professional README will simply initiate the program using "node index.js" and follow the prompts to generate an appropriate README file.

## Credits

I, John Paul Zigterman, completed this project by myself with the aid of the resources provided to me by the MSU coding bootcamp.
